Solder Rocket - How to solder kit.
=============

In the great tradition of hackerspaces everwhere, CCHS runs frequent, simple, "how to solder" courses for kids of all ages.

Our previous kit was designed by [Luke Weston](https://github.com/lukeweston/DIYBadgeKit) and had a very similar schematic.  This one has been updated for parts availability and in order to have a more "fun" board.

The "Rocket" outline was designed in Sketchup and exported as a dxf to be inputed in to KiCAD.

The "Solder Rocket" text was generated using simple text tools and imported using bitmap2component.

This updated design uses a metal battery holder.  This part does become hot during soldering but should cool quickly.
